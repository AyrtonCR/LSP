# Local Surf Project (lsp)

### This is a project I am doing in my spare time that incorporates something I love doing with what I have learnt so far in my first few semesters of Front-end and Back-end web development.

<br>

### The goal is to build from scratch a responsive website that will display information about some of my local surf breaks, forecasts, surfboards, a forum and some more features to be implemented as I go (see wire frame for more info).

## To run this project you will need to go through the following process ...

<br>

1. ### Run MongoDB through the following command ...

<br>

docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name local-surf-project mongo:latest

<br>

2. ### Import the json data from \lsp\data\surfbreak.json into the MongoDB database.

<br>

3. ### npm install in \server and \client

<br>

4. ### npm start in \server and \client

<br>

### (Further down the track the project will be hosted online via Heroku and Netlify).

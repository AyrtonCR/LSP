    "surfboard_description": "When the conditions are heavy and pumping there are certain boards that are necessary to surf the waves. At this point it is worth considering that the board is going to be fast enough to make it through the barrels.For very large beach break waves a shortboard that is squashed and stretched out to mid-length size works. If the waves are barreling with an easier take off then a high performance shortboard should work. ",

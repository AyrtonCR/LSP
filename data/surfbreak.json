However generally the waves are average or below, and it's best to know what the forecast will translate to when surfing here.",

    "surfbreak-blurb": "A solid wave when the swell and tides are right, Taylors Mistake can put out a solid hollow inside section on low tide and generally has more experienced surfers in the water. The sand bars are better than other local breaks, but bay is small causing easy overcrowding and often short rides",

    "surfbreak-blurb": "Amberly Beach sits at the top of Pegasus Bay and is often the southern-most local beach break worth going to (gas permitting). The beach drops off quickly with an unsurfable dumping inside, but turns into a fairly consistent, wally wave best surfed at low-tide on a decent sized SSE swell.",

    "surfbreak-blurb": "A little over an hours drive south of Christchurch in Banks Penninsula lies one of the best left-hand point break in the region. Although a great wave on a decent sized south-swell, it gets crowded very quickly and breaks quite close to sharp rocks. While this bay is probably not considered overly dangerous to the more experienced surfers, it has still claimed many fins and injuries over the years.",
